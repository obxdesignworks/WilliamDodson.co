  - title: 'Firefox'
    description: 'Yes, I know Firefox is a web browser. But Firefox has a neat built-in web developer tool called “Responsive Design View” that is extremely useful in developing RWD sites. You can define your own breakpoints and quickly access them with a simple keyboard shortcut. It also includes a simple button that allows you to take screen shots of the design at a chosen breakpoint. Huzzah!'
