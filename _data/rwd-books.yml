  - title: 'Mobile First'
    description: 'No discourse on RWD would be complete without a discussion of “Mobile First” design. Auhor Luke Wroblewski walks the reader through the underlying concepts behind mobile first design. If you’re doing RWD then you should be starting with the mobile user in mind at the beginning of the project and not as an afterthought.'

  - title: 'Adaptive Web Design'
    description: 'Author Aaron Gustafson takes a conversational tone with this book and offers insight in both RWD techniques and Progressive Enhancement (PE). While I feel this book is more focused on PE than RWD I think both compliment each other and this book is certainly worth mentioning here.'
