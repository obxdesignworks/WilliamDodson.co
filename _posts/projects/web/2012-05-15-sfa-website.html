  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>The Science Festival Alliance is an MIT initiative whose goal is to foster a professional community dedicated to provide better science and technology festivals. I was contracted by <a href="http://pixelslam.com/">PixelSlam</a> to to create a custom site design powered by WordPress. The site features a custom events calendar to help people find science festivals all over the country.</p>
  <p>The site uses <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> and <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> to handle CSS preprocessing for the custom WordPress theme. The site uses WordPress Custom Post Types to help make organizing content easy. I also developed a custom Events widget which can be easily embedded on any external site to allow SFA to share their events anywhere.</p>
