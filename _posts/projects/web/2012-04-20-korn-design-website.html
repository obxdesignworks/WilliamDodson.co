<section class="main">
  <p>Korn Design is a brand strategy and design firm with two offices in Boston and New York City. I was contracted by <a href="http://pixelslam.com/">PixelSlam</a> to create a responsive site design built on top of the WordPress platform. The site features bold, colorful imagery to highlight an extensive portfolio.</p>
  <p>The site uses <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> to handle CSS preprocessing for a custom responsive WordPress theme. The site makes heavy use of WordPress Custom Post Types to make organizing content easy. The masonry-style layout on the portfolio page is created using the <a href="http://isotope.metafizzy.co/">Isotope</a> jQuery plugin from Metafizzy.</p>
