<section class="main">
  <p>BotBaked owner Jenny Branley makes delicious home baked cupcakes made from scratch with <abbr class="love" title="Love">&#10084;</abbr>. Jen is often lovingly referred to as &#8220;Jennybot&#8221; due to the beeping of the insulin meter she wears on a daily basis to monitor her blood sugar. I took the robot motif and created a logo depicting a female robot presenting a very large cupcake. And so, BotBaked was born.</p>
  <p>The logo features a colorful illustration using a subtle color scheme. The &#8220;BotBaked&#8221; lettering was hand-drawn and converted to vectors in Adobe Illustrator. Nexa Book was used for the other type treatments and on the accompanying business cards.</p>
