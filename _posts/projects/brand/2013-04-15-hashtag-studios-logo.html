  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>Hashtag Studios create media for digital, online and otherwise on-demand consumption. I was approached by them to create a new logo that helped to define their brand by playing on our trusty hashtag symbol.</p>
  <p>The logo features a simple illustration of a television using a custom color scheme. Nexa Black and Nexa Book were used for the type treatments and on other collateral to help unify the look and feel across different media and contexts.</p>
