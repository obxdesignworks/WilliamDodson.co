  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>Tanglewood Branch Beer Co. is located in Fayetteville, <abbr title="Arkansas">AR</abbr> and features great food, craft-brewed beer selections, and live entertainment. One of their semi-regular events is a stand-up comedy open mic called Tangled Words. I was asked to create a logo for the event that played on the name and the comedic nature of the event.</p>
  <p>The logo features a colorful illustration of a person smiling with messy, tangled hair and uses a subtle color scheme loosely based on existing Tanglewood branding. The lettering was done using the Swung Note typeface. The uncentered design compliments the often off-kilter and unusual world of comedy.</p>
