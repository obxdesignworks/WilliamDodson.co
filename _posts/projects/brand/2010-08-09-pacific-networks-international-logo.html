  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>Pacific Networks International are dedicated to helping their clients experience lasting Hawaiian vacation memories. The company wanted me to create an indelible look that could be easily recognized amongst the highly-competitive Hawaiian vacation industry.</p>
  <p>Since “Pacific Dreams” was the customer-facing side of the company the logo features a stylized, illustrative take on the letters “P” and “d” as wave-like symbols. The design uses a custom color scheme created from some of their advertising photos. Fontin Sans Small Caps was used for the type treatments. The result is a simple but effective logomark that is distinctive even when rendered using all black.</p>
