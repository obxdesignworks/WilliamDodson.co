  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>BotBaked owner Jenny Branley makes some of the most delicious and unusual cupcakes around. Jen needed help getting the word out about these delicious home baked cupcakes and wanted to do a colorful new business card.</p>
  <p>The business card features a vertical layout to help maximize the design elements and typography. It uses a subtle custom color scheme developed while creating the logo design. The cards are printed on sturdy 15 point card stock with a <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> gloss coating and die-cut rounded corners. Jen receives lots of compliments on both her cupcakes and her business cards (I personally <abbr class="love" title="Love">&#10084;</abbr> the apple peanut butter cupcakes).</p>
