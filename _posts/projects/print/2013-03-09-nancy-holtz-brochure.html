  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>Judge Nancy Holtz (<abbr title="retired">Ret</abbr>.) served as an Associate Justice of the Massachusetts Superior Court for fifteen years. Nancy and I have worked together for a number of years now and she wanted to do a simple brochure to provide clients with clear information on what to expect from her mediation services.</p>
  <p>The brochure is a tri-fold layout and uses Calluna Sans for headings and Chaparral Pro for the body text. It uses a subdued gray color scheme with saturated blue based off of the colors from her website. It is a full color 4:4 job printed on 100# gloss book paper with an aqueous gloss coating.</p>
